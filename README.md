# About

You are looking at the source code for [discordbotlist.xyz](https://discordbotlist.xyz), made By `Pringle#2812`. This botlist is discontinued and no longer exists. You can always create your own copy of it from this source code.

# Features
This botlist is still being updated, but here's a list of current features:
 - Server count API
 - Widget
 - Discord Bot

# Contributing

You want to contribute? Go ahead and make a pull request and I'll look into it as soon as I can. 


# Copying

No problem, just check the [`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/Ankrad/discordbotlist/blob/master/LICENSE.md) before you forking it. Also, I wouldn't mind you referencing this page when you use it.  


# To do

This project is still in development. Here are some things that I am looking to add:
 - Responsive design (make it usable on mobile)
 - A form of higher verification (certification)
 - NPM module (Setup and host the botlist with a bit of config)

# Credits

Thanks to `Telk#7197`, for helping with bot verification. (when the list still existed)

Thanks to `Chinese_Marc#5516` for help with the bot widget.
