# Copying

No problem, just check the [`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/Sank6/discordbotlist/blob/master/LICENSE.md) before you forking it. Also, I wouldn't mind you referencing this page when you use it.  


# To do

This project is still in development. Here are some things that I am looking to add:
 - Responsive design (make it usable on mobile)
 - A form of higher verification (certification)
 - NPM module (Setup and host the botlist with a bit of config)
